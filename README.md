# Cloudflare A record update script
Bash script for updating the A record of a hostname at Cloudflare


Initially I got this script from [here](https://gist.github.com/4ft35t/510897486bc6986d19cac45b3b9ca1d0), but I had to modify it to run flawlessly on my ubuntu box.

This script helps me to keep the A record to my home IP address updated. Since it changes every now and then I wanted something that kept that updated.

Feel free to copy this script and adapt it to your needs.
